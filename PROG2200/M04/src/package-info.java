/**
 *Overly complicated classes that I should have started a week ago but waited until the due date.
 * @author Mason Fraser
 * @version 1.0
 * <img src="doc-files/Vehicle.png">
 *
 * SRP = Most if not ALL methods serve one singular purpose
 * OCP = Be sure your code is linted, and variables, methods, and classes are properly scoped.
 * LSP = For example, my ArrayLists COULD be made into one, however I've not done this.
 * ISP = I use an abstract method for speedControl() since air and land handle this differently.
 * DIP = (Can you explain this one again in class?) As an example my Vehicle would be a low level, and my land and air would be high level.
