This script tells you how many items are visable and hidden in the given directory
You can pass it and argument by adding a directory to the command line.
Eg. (sh scriptNameHere ./GIT_REPOS)  will tell me that my git repo has 2 visible
files (or folders, in my case) but if I do it in my home directory (sh scriptNameHere)
it will tell me I have 29 visible files and 35 hidden files.
